### Note:
* `pools.json` is (still in-use for Stratum Security protocol) and reversed for compatibility with older versions of SaladBind and detivatives.
* `pools-v2.json` is `pools.json` but switched from NiceHash Stratum to NiceHash SSL.
* `annoucement.json` is (probably maintanance and) reversed for compatibility with older versions of SaladBind and detivatives that use the annoucement feature.
