## Installation

If my pre-compiled exe's don't work for whatever reason, compile the repo yourself.
If they do work, you should probably compile it yourself anyway.

### Windows

Download the `saladbind-win.exe` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/validcube/UnstableBind/releases/latest).

### macOS and Linux

Download the `saladbind-macos`/`saladbind-linux` file from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/validcube/UnstableBind/releases/latest). For these platforms, you'll need to run UnstableBind from the terminal, due to how UnstableBind works. If you need help with using the terminal, don't be afraid to Google a bit - you'll have to use `cd` to be in the same folder that UnstableBind is in.

Use these commands to start UnstableBind, for macOS or Linux respectively:

```bash
chmod +x ./saladbind-macos # You only need to run this once
./saladbind-macos
```

```bash
chmod +x ./saladbind-linux # You only need to run this once
./saladbind-linux
```

## Configuration

Moved to https://github.com/validcube/UnstableBind/wiki/Miner-Details-Configuration

### Miner Setup Guide

If you don't know what miner, algorithm or pool to pick, see the [handy guide](https://github.com/validcube/UnstableBind/wiki/Miner-guide).

## Command line arguments

UnstableBind offers some command line arguments.

- `-d` for dumping debug data
- `-l` for starting mining with the latest settings

## Compiling

You can and probably should compile UnstableBind yourself. You'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Highly recommended that you read [Contributing guide](https://github.com/validcube/UnstableBind/wiki/Contributing) before contributing

1. Clone the repository
2. Open a terminal in the folder and run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run compile` (This may display a warning, but it's safe to ignore it)
4. Your compiled binaries will be in the `bin` folder
